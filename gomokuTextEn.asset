      Five-in-a-row is the simplest game according
      to the rules on this list. Recommended for beginners. Black makes the first
      move. Black''s first move is made to the center of the field, there are no
      restrictions on the remaining moves of the white and black player.


      Warning:
      it is mathematically proven that the black player has an advantage over the
      white one!


      Victory condition: building a row of 5 or more stones of
      your own color


      Draw condition: both players missed a move in a row
      or filled the entire field with stones, leaving no free space'

    _rawText: 'Free renju


      Free renju, in the common people "sapronovka" is
      a more advanced kind of game proposed by V. Sapronov. The first move in this
      version is also made by black, but there is one peculiarity - the second move
      of the black player must be made outside the central square marked with dots
      on the edges. This measure was taken to compensate for the capabilities of
      players of both colors


      Victory condition: building a row of exactly
      5 stones of its own color. A row longer than 5 stones does not bring victory


      Draw
      condition: both players missed a move in a row or filled the entire field with
      stones, leaving no free space'

    _rawText: 'Gomoku with a common stone


      Gomoku with a common central stone
      is another version of renju, invented by K. Kontsev from Bulgaria. The first
      move in this version is made by white, but at the beginning of the game there
      is already a special, gray stone in the center of the board. He is considered
      "his" for both players. This is another way to eliminate the advantage of a
      black player over a white one


      Victory condition: building a row of
      exactly 5 stones of its own color. A row longer than 5 stones does not bring
      victory. When counting, the central gray stone counts as a black or white stone
      for the respective players


      Draw condition: both players missed a move
      in a row or filled the entire field with stones, leaving no free space'
